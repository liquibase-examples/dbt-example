# Repository Metadata

## Basic Information
- **Repository Name**: dbt-example (liquibase-snowflake-dbt)
- **Description**: Liquibase + dbt integration pattern demonstrating schema management and analytics transformations in Snowflake
- **Created Date**: 2025-01-23
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-23
- **Complexity Level**: Intermediate

## Database Configuration
- **Database Type**: Snowflake
- **Database Version**: Current (cloud-native)
- **Connection Method**: JDBC
- **Schema Management**: Multi-schema (PUBLIC for raw data, DBT for analytics)

## Platform Integration
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Cloud Provider**: Snowflake Cloud (multi-cloud compatible)
- **Container Platform**: None (native GitHub Actions runners)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: None (focuses on database automation)

## Liquibase Features
- **Liquibase Edition**: Pro
- **Liquibase Version**: 4.29.0
- **Key Features Used**:
  - [x] Flow
  - [ ] Drift Detection
  - [ ] Policy Checks
  - [ ] Generate Changelog
  - [x] Rollback
  - [ ] Targeted Updates
  - [ ] Structured Logging
  - [x] Other: Artifact creation for release management

## Use Cases
- **Primary Use Case**: Modern data platform with separate concerns for schema management and analytics
- **Secondary Use Cases**: 
  - CI/CD automation for database changes
  - Analytics model deployment with dbt
  - Release management with rollback capabilities
- **Industry/Domain**: E-commerce/Retail analytics
- **Team Size**: Medium 5-20 (separate data engineering and analytics teams)

## Customer Scenarios
- **Target Customer Profile**: Organizations with dedicated data teams using modern data stack (Snowflake + dbt + CI/CD)
- **Common Pain Points Addressed**: 
  - Schema drift between environments
  - Coordinating database changes with analytics deployments
  - Manual deployment processes
  - Lack of rollback capabilities
- **Business Value Delivered**: 
  - Automated, repeatable deployments
  - Clear separation of schema and analytics responsibilities
  - Reduced deployment risk with rollback capabilities
  - Faster time-to-market for analytics changes
- **Demo Duration**: 30min (setup + deployment workflow demonstration)

## Technical Patterns
- **Deployment Strategy**: Direct deployment with artifact-based releases
- **Environment Management**: Dev auto-deploy, Prod manual release approval
- **Secrets Management**: GitHub Secrets with environment-specific variables
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Liquibase reporting, GitHub Actions logging

## Dependencies
- **External Tools**: 
  - Snowflake account with appropriate permissions
  - GitHub repository with Actions enabled
  - dbt CLI (for local development)
- **Third-party Integrations**: 
  - Snowflake JDBC driver
  - dbt-snowflake adapter
  - GitHub Actions marketplace actions
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Snowflake account setup with databases and users
  - GitHub secrets configuration
  - Liquibase Pro license

## Customization Points
- **Easily Configurable**: 
  - Database connection details
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - dbt model definitions
  - GitHub Actions triggers
- **Requires Modification**: 
  - Schema design (table structures)
  - Analytics model logic
  - Workflow approval processes
- **Not Recommended to Change**: 
  - Core separation of Liquibase vs dbt responsibilities
  - Artifact-based release pattern

## Known Limitations
- **Platform Limitations**: 
  - Requires Snowflake (not portable to other databases without modification)
  - Requires Liquibase Pro for Flow features
- **Scale Limitations**: 
  - Single database/schema approach (would need modification for multi-tenant)
  - Sequential deployment (no parallel environment deployments)
- **Feature Gaps**: 
  - No automated testing of data quality
  - No data lineage tracking
  - No drift detection implementation

## Related Repositories
- **Similar Patterns**: 
  - mongodb-with-diff (different database technology)
  - Any other CI/CD database automation patterns
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Alternatives**: 
  - Pure dbt approach with dbt-core for schema management
  - Terraform-based infrastructure with database provisioning
  - Traditional DBA manual deployment processes
